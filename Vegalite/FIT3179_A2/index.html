          <p style="text-align:center">World Economics often contains useful information for data analysis. Income <br>
            and GDP are the most interesting topics of all time.<br>In 1978, the first World Development Report 
            introduced groupings <br> of <b>low income</b> and <b>middle income</b> countries. 
          <br><br>In the 1983 WDR, the Middle Income Group was <b>split</b> into 
              <br><b>lower middle</b> and <b>upper middle</b> groups and in 1989, <br>
              a <b>high income</b> country definition was introduced.</p>

            <h2>Human Development Index</h2>
            <p>Now we know that World Income has been <b>increasing</b> as <b>green colour increases</b>, 
                we can see how the world has developed through years. </p>
            <p>We use a measure called the <b>Human Development Index</b>.
               The HDI is a summary composite measure of a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development:<br>
                <b>Health, Knowledge and Standard of living.</b> </p>
              <p>The slope graph on the right shows the change of the HDI values of each continent. Note how all of them <b>increases</b>.</p>
              <p>The legend can be clicked to select a specific continent.</p>
            <p>Out of the 3 aspects mentioned above, I will include visualisations for two aspects: <b>Education and Health.</b></p>

              <p>Notice how the <b>latest period (After 2010)</b> 
                 usually has the <b>highest value.</b> From this graph, we can say that governments are spending more of country income

              <p>This is because, as <b>income</b> increases, people's lives improves, and

            <p>It is a good thing now that Governments are spending more on Healthcare
              and people are being protected. </p>
              <p>This is good because governments and people now know the importance of health,
              and it is a lifelong investment.</p>

            <p>The two graphs below show how the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a <b>Continent</b>

            to determine the development of a country: <b>Child Mortality Rate.</b>

            <h2>Child Mortality Rate by Continents</h2>
              <p>It is good to see that the <b>Child Mortality Rate has decreased </b>
                  in all continents, especially <b>Africa</b>.</p>
              <p>Another interesting observation is how <b>Health Expenditure affects Child Mortality Rate.</b></p>
                 <p>Note how the <b>width </b>of the lines shows the relationship: 
            <b>As Health Expenditure increases, Child Mortality Rate decreases.</b> </p>
              <p>It is available to <b>select by Continents</b> from the legend, to see the line for

            <h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
              <p>Finally, our final graph shows the relationship between <b>Life Expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b>
                  throughout the years. </p>
              <p>If we alide through the years, we can see that Life Expextancy and GDP per capita
                  is constantly <b>positively correlated.</b></p>
              <p>I think this result is expected, the reason is explained as: As income increases, education rate increases, 
                  <b>people gain more awareness for health</b>, and take care of their health better. Hence, <b>Life Expectancy increases.</b></p>
              <p>Other than that, we can also see how the cluster of bubbles are moving towards the right as a whole. 
                  This shows the same result as our other graphs above about the increase in
                  World Income, and the improvement in Health.</p>
